## What is AB testing?
A/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a **user experience research methodology.** A/B tests consist of a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to **compare two versions of a single variable**, typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and **determining which of the two variants is more effective**.
